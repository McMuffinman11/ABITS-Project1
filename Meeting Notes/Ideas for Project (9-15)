Main Idea:
  Clicking starts a timer, clicking stops a timer. We make a game out of this.

Gameplay Ideas:
  Wait for a traffic light to turn green. Whoever clicks fast enough wins.
      Include more conditions: not just time. Try to predict the color as well. This will determine score.
      Color is randomly changing -- it's all based on chance. 
        Difficulty level -- time would factor into one, different colors. Account for difficulty here with tournament mode.

Include multiple games. Tournament mode that keeps a dynamic standardized score.
         
Design Ideas:
  Main title screen that offers options to choose a mini game, settings, and exit. MAYBE a save/load game feature.
